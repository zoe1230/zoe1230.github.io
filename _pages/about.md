<div style="text-align: justify;">
<!-- <br> -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Master's student in Instrument Science and Technology at Tianjin University, expected to graduate in 2026 under the supervision of Prof. Yanbiao Sun.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, during my research internship at Santachi in Summer 2024, I focused on developing vision algorithms for anti-external damage systems in power transmission scenarios, which sparked my interest in applying AI to critical infrastructure monitoring.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I'm working within the Industry Vision Computing (IVC) research group, which aims to tackle real-world engineering challenges through innovative computational approaches. Welcome to join us!
